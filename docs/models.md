**ligand-based models**

One example of a ligand-based model is quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling. QSAR is a widely used technique in drug discovery and design that aims to predict the biological activity of a molecule based on its structural features and physicochemical properties.

In QSAR modeling, the molecular structure of a molecule is represented by a set of numerical descriptors, such as molecular weight, logP, or electrostatic potential, which capture various aspects of the molecule's structure and properties. These descriptors are then used as input to a machine learning algorithm, which learns to predict the biological activity of the molecule based on the descriptors.

There are many different types of machine learning algorithms that can be used for QSAR modeling, including linear regression, support vector machines (SVMs), random forests, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Each algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses and may be more suitable for certain types of data or modeling tasks.

Once the machine learning algorithm has been trained on a set of known active and inactive compounds, it can be used to predict the activity of new compounds. The performance of the model can be evaluated using various performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or area under the curve (AUC).

Overall, QSAR modeling is a powerful and widely used technique for ligand-based drug discovery and design, as it can predict the biological activity of molecules based on their molecular structure and physicochemical properties, without requiring knowledge of the target protein.

The state-of-the-art (SOTA) for ligand-based models in drug discovery and design is constantly evolving, as new techniques and models are developed and validated. However, one of the most widely used and successful approaches is deep learning-based models, particularly deep neural networks (DNNs).

DNNs have been shown to be effective in capturing complex relationships between molecular structure and activity, and have achieved high levels of accuracy and generalization in many drug discovery and design applications. For example, DNN-based models have been used to predict the activity of molecules in various drug discovery and design tasks, such as protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, virtual screening, and hit-to-lead optimization.

Some notable examples of DNN-based ligand-based models include the DeepChem library, which provides a collection of deep learning models for drug discovery and design tasks, and the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model, which is a type of DNN that is particularly suited to processing molecular graphs.

It's worth noting that the effectiveness of a ligand-based model depends on many factors, including the quality and diversity of the training data, the choice of descriptors, and the choice of machine learning algorithm. Therefore, it's important to carefully evaluate and validate any model before applying it to drug discovery and design tasks.

**structure-based models**

Structure-based models are a type of machine learning model used in drug discovery and design that predict the biological activity of a molecule based on its interaction with a specific target protein. These models take into account the 3D structure of the protein and the molecule, as well as the physics and chemistry of their interactions.

In a structure-based model, the 3D structures of the target protein and the molecule are obtained through experimental or computational methods. The structures are then used to calculate various molecular features, such as binding energies, hydrogen bonding patterns, or electrostatic potentials. These features are used as input to a machine learning algorithm, which learns to predict the activity of the molecule based on its interaction with the protein.

The machine learning algorithm can be trained using various techniques, such as regression or classification, and can be evaluated using various performance metrics, such as accuracy or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The performance of the model can also be improved through various techniques, such as molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, or free energy calculations.

Structure-based models are particularly useful when there is a known target protein for a given disease or condition, as they can provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of drug action and aid in the design of more effective drugs. However, they may require more computational resources and expertise compared to ligand-based models, and may be less effective for predicting the activity of molecules with novel structures or those that interact with multiple targets.

What is the SOTA for structure-based models?

The state-of-the-art (SOTA) for structure-based models in drug discovery and design is constantly evolving, as new techniques and models are developed and validated. However, one of the most widely used and successful approaches is molecular dynamics (MD)-based models.

MD simulations are a computational technique that allows the study of the physical and chemical behavior of molecules over time. In MD simulations, the 3D structures of the protein and the molecule are modeled as a system of interacting atoms, and the system is simulated using classical mechanics to predict its behavior over time. This simulation can provide information about the binding dynamics and thermodynamics of the molecule

Other approaches to structure-based modeling include protein-ligand docking, which predicts the binding orientation of a ligand to a protein based on the shape and electrostatics of the molecules, and molecular mechanics (MM)-based models, which use classical mechanics to calculate the energy of a system of atoms and predict its behavior over time.

Overall, MD-based models are one of the most promising approaches to structure-based modeling in drug discovery and design, as they can provide detailed information about the molecular mechanisms of drug action and aid in the design of more effective drugs. However, they require significant computational resources and expertise, and their accuracy and generalizability depend on many factors, including the quality of the training data, the choice of machine learning algorithm, and the accuracy of the molecular force field used in the simulations.

**multi-task models**

Multi-task models are a type of machine learning model used in drug discovery and design that can predict multiple properties or tasks for a given molecule, such as its bioactivity, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic properties. These models are able to simultaneously learn and predict multiple tasks, rather than treating each task as a separate problem.

In a multi-task model, the molecular structure of a molecule is represented as a set of numerical descriptors, which may include ligand-based, structure-based, or hybrid descriptors. These descriptors are then used as input to a machine learning algorithm, which learns to predict multiple properties or tasks for the molecule.

Multi-task models can be trained using various techniques, such as multi-task learning, which involves jointly optimizing the model for all tasks, or transfer learning, which involves transferring knowledge learned from one task to another related task. The models can be evaluated using various performance metrics, such as accuracy or AUC, for each task.

Multi-task models are particularly useful in drug discovery and design, as they can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the properties of a molecule and aid in the identification and prioritization of promising drug candidates. They can also reduce the number of models that need to be developed and validated, saving time and resources. However, they may require more complex architectures and larger datasets compared to single-task models, and their performance may be limited by the complexity and diversity of the tasks involved.

The state-of-the-art (SOTA) for multi-task models in drug discovery and design is constantly evolving, as new techniques and models are developed and validated. However, one of the most widely used and successful approaches is deep learning-based models, particularly deep neural networks (DNNs).

DNN-based multi-task models have been shown to be effective in predicting multiple properties or tasks for a given molecule, such as bioactivity, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic properties, and have achieved high levels of accuracy and generalization in many drug discovery and design applications. For example, DNN-based multi-task models have been used for drug repurposing, multi-target drug design, and drug combination prediction.

One of the advantages of DNN-based multi-task models is that they can learn complex relationships between the molecular structure and multiple properties or tasks, without requiring domain-specific knowledge or feature engineering. They can also leverage transfer learning techniques to transfer knowledge learned from one task to another related task, improving the performance and efficiency of the model.

Some notable examples of DNN-based multi-task models in drug discovery and design include the DeepDTA model, which predicts the binding affinity between a protein and a drug, the DeepPurpose model, which predicts the polypharmacology of a drug, and the ChemBERTa model, which predicts multiple properties of a molecule based on its SMILES representation.

It's worth noting that the effectiveness of a multi-task model depends on many factors, including the quality and diversity of the training data, the choice of descriptors, and the choice of machine learning algorithm. Therefore, it's important to carefully evaluate and validate any model before applying it to drug discovery and design tasks.
