# Project Overview: Optimizing Synthetic Pathways with Deep Learning

## Project Goals and Scope

### Drug Discovery and Design using Machine Learning Models

**Goal**: The primary goal of this project is to develop and validate machine learning models that can predict the bioactivity, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic properties of candidate molecules for drug discovery and design. The models will aid in the identification and prioritization of promising drug candidates, accelerating the drug discovery process and reducing the associated costs and time.

**Scope**:

   1. *Data Collection*: Gather relevant datasets containing information on molecular structures, bioactivity, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics for a diverse set of compounds.
   2. *Data Preprocessing*: Clean, standardize, and preprocess the collected data, converting molecular structures into suitable representations for machine learning models.
   3. *Model Development*: Develop and train various machine learning models, including ligand-based, structure-based, and multi-task models, to predict the properties of candidate molecules.
   4. *Model Validation*: Evaluate and compare the performance of the developed models using appropriate validation techniques and performance metrics.
   5. *Virtual Screening*: Apply the best-performing models to screen a large database of compounds, identifying and prioritizing potential drug candidates.
   6. *Hit-to-Lead Optimization*:Optimize the identified hits by analyzing their molecular structures and properties, generating analogs with improved potency, selectivity, and drug-like properties.
   7. *Lead Optimization*: Further refine the leads by evaluating their physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and safety properties, aiming to maximize their potential for successful development.
   8. *Model Validation and Performance Evaluation*: Test the final models on a separate test set to evaluate their robustness, accuracy, and generalizability.
   9. *Documentation and Presentation*: Thoroughly document the project's methodology, results, and insights, and create a compelling presentation that highlights the value of the developed models for drug discovery and design.
   10. *Future Work*: Identify potential improvements, extensions, or applications of the developed models and outline a plan for future work in this area.
