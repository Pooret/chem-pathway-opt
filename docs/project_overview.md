# Project Overview: Optimizing Synthetic Pathways with Deep Learning
## Introduction

Designing efficient synthetic pathways is a critical task in the chemistry and pharmaceutical industries. Traditional methods for pathway design can be time-consuming and may not always yield optimal results. This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to predict chemical reaction outcomes, perform retrosynthetic analysis, and optimize synthetic pathways based on multiple criteria such as the number of steps, cost, waste, and toxic by-products.

## Objectives

    1. Predict chemical products and reaction outcomes using a deep learning model trained on a diverse dataset of chemical reactions.
    2. Perform retrosynthetic analysis to identify potential synthetic routes for target molecules using a deep learning model.
    3. Optimize synthetic pathways based on multiple objectives, such as minimizing the number of steps, cost, waste, and toxic by-products.

## Methodology

    1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Collect data from various sources like the USPTO dataset, Reaxys, and PubChem. Preprocess the data by converting molecular structures into standardized SMILES representations and splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets.
    **Reaction Prediction Model**: Train a deep learning model, such as a Molecular Transformer or graph neural network, to predict the products of chemical reactions based on input reactants and conditions.
    **Retrosynetic Analysis**: Train a deep learning model to predict the optimal starting reagents based on input products.
