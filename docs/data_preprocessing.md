## Data Sources

1. USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office) dataset: This dataset contains chemical reactions extracted from the USPTO patent database. It covers a wide range of reaction types and can be used for training reaction prediction models. The dataset can be accessed through the USPTO website (https://www.uspto.gov/) or via repositories like Figshare (https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Chemical_reactions_from_US_patents_1976-Sep2016_/5104873).

2. Reaxys database: Reaxys (https://www.reaxys.com/) is a comprehensive database of chemical reactions, substances, and properties. It contains a vast amount of experimental data and is widely used in the field of organic chemistry. Access to Reaxys requires a subscription, but it can be an invaluable resource for reaction pathway prediction.

3. PubChem: PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) is a public repository of chemical information, including compound structures, biological activities, and chemical reactions. You can use the PubChem API to access and download chemical reaction data for your research.

4. ChemReaX: ChemReaX (http://chemeqlibrary.sourceforge.net/) is an open-source chemical reaction database that contains over 8,000 well-documented reactions. The dataset can be downloaded from the project's SourceForge page.

5.  Organic Chemistry Reactions (OCR) dataset: OCR dataset is a curated set of organic chemistry reactions extracted from scientific literature. You can access it via the author's GitHub repository (https://github.com/connorcoley/ord-data). (https://github.com/open-reaction-database)

6. KEGG: The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/) is a widely-used resource for bioinformatics and systems biology research. KEGG includes a comprehensive collection of biochemical reactions, many of which are relevant to reaction pathway prediction.

7. Rhea: Rhea (https://www.rhea-db.org/) is a curated database of biochemical reactions that can be used for pathway prediction. It provides reaction data in various formats and can be accessed through its web interface or API.

8. Chemical Kinetics Database: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) maintains a Chemical Kinetics Database (https://kinetics.nist.gov/kinetics/) containing data on gas-phase reactions, which could be useful for reaction pathway prediction in certain contexts.
