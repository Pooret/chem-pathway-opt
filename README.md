# Machine Learning-Based Drug Discovery Project

This project aims to accelerate the drug discovery process by developing and validating machine learning models for efficient and accurate virtual screening and hit identification. By integrating machine learning with traditional drug discovery methods, we hope to improve the success rate of drug candidates and reduce the time and cost associated with drug development.
